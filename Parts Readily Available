-Main Board
1x  Bigtree tech board <--has TMC drivers to do current based sensing of end stops
Unfortunately I believe we will need more drivers than this board can support... we need a different board
I would prefer to use the 2208 TMC drivers I have, but am open to suggestions if there is a better option (I wanted sensorless homing from these)

Any Suggestions of any kind?
