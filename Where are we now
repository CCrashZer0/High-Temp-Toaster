Where are we now?

Motion system
Sinking bed style Z axis with an X-Y moving print head
The printer is effectively upside down once constructed with the build plate lifting up as the part grows in height
Build plate lifts into what is effectively an open bottomed box
Ball screw or at least lead screw based to keep X, Y, & Z steppers outside the hot areas without concerns about heat exposure or stretching of belts
System should be 50% oversized beyond desired print area to accommodate insulation etc.
Extruder options
Water cooling
Small aluminum or copper water blocks would be a good option
Heat break
Stepper gets 2 or 3
Lightweight silicone tubing would carry plenty of water while insulating fairly well
Keep the pressure fairly brisk by using multiple pumps in multiple parts of the loop
Peltier cooling
Peltier effect is based upon fairly small differences in temperature that we might exploit
Peltier/heatsink/fan combo could do double duty as both heat break management & as an integrated active heater for our chamber since we are talking 500+ celcius on the hot end
Might require some additional automation to adjust/pulse the system to regulate temperatures without causing issues when used to print lower temperature materials
Maybe an added arduino
Cable drive
Extruders such as the "Zesty Nimble" already exist
I believe we could design our own with a dremel cable handle, weed eater cable drive, etc.
How hard can it be to take an off the shelf part and design new connections for creating a remote drive extruder that keeps our extruder motor outside any heat? LOL
Heated Enclosure
Insulated with KaoWool ceramic kiln insulation
Actively heated (Options)
a pair of 12v forced air "Automotive heaters"
might have to baffle to control airflow
Nichrome resistance wire
multiple zones based upon height might help with energy efficiency
Off the shelf PTC controller 
available in many configs for VERY little money
Must have fairly still air inside
Prevent significant airflow within the heated chamber to prevent part warping
