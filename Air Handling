I believe any additional air movement within the print chamber should be kept to a minimum at all times it is above roughly ambient temperature.
Reasons
  -Air movement is likely to instigate warping from a previously stable part
  -Some of these filaments are NASTY and either offgas or create particles that are human hazards
  -Some materials need to be heat treated to stabilize their structure and/or relieve stresses which could be done from the build plate in some cases

Proposal
  -Keep the enclosure sealed from "Start" to "Eject"
  -Print with heated chamber and no additional air handling other than temperature management
  -Allow chamber to cool at desired rate for material
  -Once below whatever threshold, begin evacuation system to fully change the air inside the chamber several times before allowing the chamber to open
  -This would allow us to setup an emergency "purge" button to exhaust everything instantly in case we need to open the door

After-Print Evacuation & Filtration system
Operates as the final step in the cooldown process for each print
Requires keeping the printer "air sealed" for the entire warm-up, printing, and cooldown processes
Activated Carbon filtration to ensure VOCs have been removed
HEPA rated filter to ensure all harmful particulates have been removed
Maybe an inline hose fan to move air from enclosure through filters
Negative pressure is the best way to ensure nothing escapes the enclosure
Small aquarium pump might be enough if the enclosure is truly sealed
Must be either exhausted completely or filtered also
