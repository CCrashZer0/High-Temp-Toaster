Affordable high temperature filament 3D printer

We are working toward an affordable 3D printer capable of printing high temperature engineering filaments. Current printers capable of turning out reliable parts from PEKK, PSU, etc. cost several thousand USD; but I think we can do better for cheaper.

The Dream

3D printers capable of turning out usable parts from PEKK, PEEK, or PEI typically start around $7000 USD, so we are trying to design and build the first "affordable" printer to do it. (PEEK cost ~$500USD/1kg for perspective on affordable)

When can I play too?

Before releasing plans, manuals, etc. this stuff must exist, so we are planning to create all that stuff AFTER producing a working, tested, & reproducible system that does the thing.
